Lecture notes on basic topology
===============================

Building
--------

To get and build the notes through a terminal, the easiest
is to use latexmk which ensures that all files are built in
the right order and the correct number of times. If you have
latexmk, run

    $ git clone https://github.com/fuglede/basic-topology
    $ cd basic-topology
    $ latexmk -pdf main

The result will be available as `main.pdf`.
