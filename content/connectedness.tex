\section{Connectedness}
\label{connectedness}
In $\bbR^n$, we have a good intuituion about what it means for subsets to be connected or not. For example, the subset $(-2,-1) \cup (1,2)$ does seem very connected: how would we connect $-1$ and $1$? On the other hand, $(-2,2)$ should probably deserve to be called connected.

It turns out that having open sets is sufficient to define a notion of connectedness that agrees with out intuition in the intuitive examples; this is the subject of this sections.

\subsection{Connectedness}
\begin{defn}
  Let $X$ be a topological space. A \word{separation}{?} of $X$ is a pair $U$, $V$ of disjoint non-empty open subsets of $X$ so that $X = U \cup V$. We say that $X$ is \word{connected}{sammanh{\"a}ngande} if it has no separation.
\end{defn}
\trans{separation}{?}\trans{connected}{sammanh{\"a}ngande}
