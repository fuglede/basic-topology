\section{Compactness and sequential compactness}
\label{compactness}
\subsection{Compactness}
\begin{defn}
  Let $(X,\calT)$ be a topological space.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] A collection $\calU \subset \calT$ of open sets of called an \wordexp{open~cover}{{\"o}ppen~{\"o}vert{\"a}ckning}{cover}{{\"o}vert{\"a}ckning} of $X$ if $X = \bigcup_{U \in \calU} U$.
    \item[(ii)] The space $X$ is called \word{compact}{kompakt} if \emph{every} open cover $\calU$ of $X$ has a finite subcover, meaning that one can find finitely many open sets $U_1, \dots, U_n \in \calU$ so that $X = \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\trans{cover}{{\"o}vert{\"a}ckning}
\trans{compact}{kompakt}
\begin{example}
  Every finite topological space is compact, since there are only finitely many open sets. Thus, given any open cover $\calU$, the open cover $\calU$ is itself a finite subcover.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  \label{reals-not-compact}
  The real line $\bbR$ is not compact: consider the open cover $\calU$ consisting of the open sets $U_n = (-n,n)$, $n \in \bbN$. Clearly, it is impossible to choose finitely many such $U_n$ and still have something that covers all of $\bbR$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  The subspace $A = \{1/n \mid n \in \bbN\} \subset \bbR$ is not compact. One can see that $U_n = \{1/n\}$ is an open set in the subspace topology, so letting $\calU = \{U_n \mid n \in \bbN\}$, we get an open cover of $A$. Clearly, we can not find a finite subcover, since any finite subcover would cover only finitely many points of the infinite set $A$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  Let $X = A \cup \{0\}$, where $A$ is the set from the previous example. We claim that $X$ is compact. Let $\calU$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. Then there is an open set $U \in \calU$ so that $0 \in U$. By definition of the topology on $\bbR$, $U$ will contain the points $1/n$ for all large enough $n$, say all $n > N$ for some $N$. Since $\calU$ is an open cover, we can also find open sets $U_1, \dots, U_N \in \calU$ so that $1/k \in U_k$ for all $k = 1, \dots, N$. We now see that the collection $U, U_1, \dots, U_N$ together form a finite subcover of $X$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  The half-open interval $(0,1] \subset \bbR$ is not compact since the open cover $\calU$ consisting of open sets $U_n = (\tfrac{1}{n},1]$, $n \in \bbN$, does not have a finite subcover, by more or less the same argument as in Example~\ref{reals-not-compact}. Similarly, $(0,1)$ is not compact, since the sets $(\tfrac{1}{n},1-\tfrac{1}{n})$ form an open cover with no finite subcover.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  \label{interval-compact}
  The closed interval $[0,1] \subset \bbR$ is compact. This is a special case of the Heine--Borel theorem, Theorem~\ref{heine-borel}, which we show below.
\end{example}
In the following theorems, we will collect a number of properties of compact sets that we will use over and over again.
\begin{thm}
  \label{closed-in-compact}
  A closed subspace of a compact space is compact.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Let $A \subset X$ be closed, and assume that $X$ is compact. To show that $A$ is compact, let $\calU = \{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover of $A$. That is, every $U_i$ is open in $A$ in the subspace topology. By definition, we can find for every $i \in I$ open subsets $V_i$ of $X$ so that $U_i = A \cap V_i$. Since the $U_i$ cover $A$, it follows that the family $\calV = \{V_i\}_{i \in I} \cup \{A^c\}$ is an open cover of $X$; open because $A$ was assumed to be closed. Since $X$ is compact, there is a finite subcover $V_{i_1}, \dots, V_{i_n} \in \calV$ of $X$. Going, we see that $V_{i_1} \cap A, \dots, V_{i_n} \cap A \in \calU$ form a finite subcover of $A$, which is what we wanted to prove.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
  \label{compact-in-Hausdorff}
  A compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Assume that $X$ is a Hausdorff space, and let $A \subset X$ be compact. We want to show that $A^c$ is open, and we will use the usual trick of showing that very point in $A^c$ has an open neighbourhood contained entirely in $A^c$, so that $A^c = \Int A^c$.
  
  Let $x \in A^c$ be a fixed point (and notice that if $A^c = \emptyset$, there is little to prove). For every point $y \in A$, we can find disjoint neighbourhoods $U_y$ and $V_y$ of $x$ and $y$ respectively, since $X$ is Hausdorff. Now the collection $\{A \cap V_y\}_{y \in A}$ is an open cover of $A$, and since $A$ is compact, we can choose finitely many $y_1, \dots, y_n$ so that $\{A \cap V_{y_i}\}_{i=1,\dots,n}$ is a finite subcover. In particular, $A \subset V_{y_1} \cup \dots \cup V_{y_n}$.
  
  Let $U^x = U_{y_1} \cap \dots \cap U_{y_n}$. Now $U^x$ is open by (T3), and $U^x \subset A^c$: if $z \in U^x$, then $z \in V_{y_i}^c$ for every $i = 1, \dots, n$, so $z \in (V_{y_1} \cup \dots \cup V_{y_n})^c \subset A^c$.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
  \label{funcs-compact}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, assume that $X$ is compact, and let $f : X \to Y$ be a continuous map. Then the image $f(X) \subset Y$ is compact. If furthermore $Y$ is Hausdorff, and $f$ is a bijection, then $f$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\calU = \{U_i \}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover of $f(X)$ and let us find a finite subcover. Define $V_i = f^{-1}(U_i)$ for every $i$. Then $\{V_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an open cover of $X$ which has a finite subcover $\{V_{i_1}, \dots, V_{i_n}\}$ since $X$ is compact. Now clearly, the corresponding collection $\{U_{i_1}, \dots, U_{i_n}\}$ is a finite subcover of $f(X)$.
  
  Assume now that $Y$ is Hausdorff and $f$ is bijective. We have to show that $f^{-1}$ is continuous, so let $U \subset X$ be open, and let us show that $f(U)$ is also open. To do so, note that $U^c$ is closed and thus compact by Theorem~\ref{closed-in-compact}. By the first part of the theorem, $f(U)^c = f(U^c)$ is also compact. By Theorem~\ref{compact-in-Hausdorff}, this means that $f(U)^c$ is closed, so $f(U)$ is open.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
  \label{cont-compact-Hausdorff}
  If $f: X \to Y$ is continuous and injective, $X$ is compact, and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $f : X \to f(X)$ is a homeomorphism.  
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  This follows from the theorem above since $f(X)$ is Hausdorff by Exercise~1.\ref{subspace-Hausdoff} and $f : X \to f(X)$ is a bijection.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
  \label{compact-quotient}
  If $p : X \to Y$ is a quotient map, and $X$ is compact, then so is $Y$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  Quotient maps are continuous and surjective, so the claim follows from Theorem~\ref{funcs-compact}.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
  \label{s1-compact}
  If we trust Example~\ref{interval-compact} which says that $[0,1]$ is compact, it follows that $S^1$ is compact, since the map $f:[0,1] \to S^1$ given by $f(x) = (\cos(2\pi x),\sin(2\pi x))$ is continuous and surjective. Alternatively, one could combine Example~\ref{circle-from-interval} and Corollary~\ref{compact-quotient}
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  A \word{simple closed curve}{enkel sluten kurva} in a topological space $X$ is a continuous injective map $f : S^1 \to X$. If $X$ is Hausdorff, then $f : S^1 \to f(S^1)$ is a homeomorphism by Corollary~\ref{cont-compact-Hausdorff}.
\end{example}
\trans{simple closed curve}{enkel sluten kurva}

Our next goal will be to see that any products of compact spaces are compact. To do so, the following result will be useful.

\begin{lem}[The tube lemma]
  \index{tube lemma}Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces where $Y$ is compact. If $N$ is an open set of $X \times Y$ which contains $\{x_0\} \times Y$ for some $x_0 \in X$, then $N$ contains a ``tube'' $W \times Y$, where $W \subset X$ is a neighbourhood of $x_0$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Since $N$ is open we can choose, by the definition of the product topology, for any $y \in Y$ an open neighbourhood $U_y \times V_y \subset N$ of $(x_0,y)$. Since the map $Y \to X \times Y$ given by $y \mapsto (x_0,y)$ is continuous, its image $\{x_0\} \times Y$ is compact by Theorem~\ref{funcs-compact}. Therefore, since $\{U_y \times V_y\}_{y \in Y}$ is an open cover of $\{x_0 \} \times Y$, we can find $y_1, \dots, y_n \in Y$ so that $\{U_{y_1} \times V_{y_1}, \dots, U_{y_n} \times V_{y_n}\}$ is a subcover of $\{x_0 \} \times Y$. Now, let $W = \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_{y_i}$. Then $W$ is open by (T3), and is a non-empty neighbourhood of $x_0$. By construction, $W \times Y = W \times (V_{y_1} \cup \dots \cup V_{y_n}) \subset N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
  \label{tikhonov-theorem}
  Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be topological spaces. Then $\prod_{i=1}^n X_i$ is compact if and only if $X_i$ is compact for all $i = 1, \dots, n$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  If the product is compact, then so is every $X_i$, since $X_i$ is the image of a continuous map; the projection.
  
  For the converse, by induction it suffices to show that a product $X \times Y$ of two compact spaces is compact. Let $\calU$ be an open cover of $X \times Y$. As in the proof of the tube lemma, for every $x \in X$ the space $\{x \} \times Y$ is compact. Therefore, its open cover $\{ (\{x\} \times Y) \cap U \mid U \in \calU\}$ has a finite subcover by sets
  \[
    (\{x\} \times Y) \cap U_i^x,
  \]
  where $i = 1, \dots, n$, and all $U_i^x$ are in $\calU$. Let $N_x = \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i^x$. Then by the tube lemma, there is a neighbourhood $W_x$ of $x$ so that $W_x \times Y \subset N_x$. Now the collection $\{W_x \mid x \in X\}$ is an open cover of $X$, and since $X$ is compact, we can find finitely many elements $x_1, \dots, x_m \in X$ so that $\{W_{x_1}, \dots, W_{x_m}\}$ is a finite subcover. We claim that the finite collection
  \[
    \{U_i^{x_j} \mid i = 1, \dots, n,\ j = 1, \dots, m \} \subset \calU
  \]
  covers $X$. To see this, let $(x,y) \in X \times Y$ be arbitrary. Then there is a $j \in \{1, \dots, m\}$ so that $x \in W_{x_j}$, and $(x,y) \in N_{x_j}$, and then by definition of $N_{x_j}$, there is an $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ so that $(x,y) \in U_i^{x_j}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
  The same result holds true even if one allows infinite products; this general statement is known as Tikhonov's theorem\index{Tikhonov's theorem}. We refer to \cite[\S 37]{Mun} for the details.
\end{rem}
\begin{example}
  If we trust Example~\ref{s1-compact} which said that $S^1$ is compact, it follows from Theorem~\ref{tikhonov-theorem} that the $n$-torus $T^n = S^1 \times \cdots \times S^1$ is also compact.
\end{example}
Before moving on, let us remark that one can also characterize compactness in terms of closed sets rather than open sets:
\begin{defn}
  A collection of subsets $\calC \subset \calP(X)$ of a set $X$ is said to have the \word{finite intersection property}{?} if for every finite subcollection $\{C_1, \dots, C_n\} \subset \calC$, one has $\bigcap_{i=1}^n C_i \not= \emptyset$.
\end{defn}
\trans{finite intersection property}{?}
\begin{prop}
  A topological space $X$ is compact if and only if any collection $\calC$ of closed subsets of $X$ with the finite intersection property satisfies $\bigcap_{C \in \calC} C \not= \emptyset$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Exercise.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Sequential compactness}
In this section, we introduce a different notion of compactness that might look more familiar.

\begin{defn}
  A topological space is called \word{sequentially compact}{?} if every sequence in it has a convergent subsequence.
\end{defn}
\trans{sequentially compact}{?}

\begin{thm}
  \label{seq-compact-vs-compact}
  Let $X$ be a topological space.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] If $X$ is first countable, then compactness of $X$ implies sequential compactness.
    \item[(ii)] If $X$ is a metric space with the metric topology, then compactness and sequential compactness of $X$ are equivalent.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Assume that $X$ is first countable and compact. Let $\{x_n\}$ be any sequence and let us show that it has a convergent subsequence. Assume first that there is a point $x \in X$ with the property that for any neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, there are infinitely many $n$ so that $x_n \in U$. Let $\{B_i\}$ be a countable basis at $x$ and let $U_k = \bigcap_{i=1}^k B_i$, which is a neighbourhood of $x$. Then $x_n \in U_k$ for infinitely many $n$, so in particular we can choose $x_{n_k} \in U_k$ for some increasing sequence $n_k$; we claim that $\{x_{n_k}\}$ converges to $x$.  For any neighbourhood $U$ there exists an $N \in \bbN$ so that $B_N \subset U$. It follows that for all $k$ with $n_k > N$,
  \[
    x_{n_k} \in U_{n_k} \subset U_N \subset B_N \subset U,
  \]
  which says that $x_{n_k} \to x$.
  
  Suppose now that no $x$ has the property we used above; that is, suppose that for every $x \in X$ there is a neighbourhood $U_x$ of $x$ so that only finitely many $x_n$ are in $U_x$. We will use compactness of $X$ to arrive at a contradiction. The collection $\{U_x \mid x \in X\}$ is a cover of $X$, so by compactness we get finitely many points $y_1, \dots, y_n \in X$ so that $U_{y_1}, \dots, U_{y_n}$ cover $X$. This is impossible though since then, at least one of the $U_{y_i}$ must contain infinitely many of the $x_n$.
  
  Next we turn our attention to the metric case. First of all, recall that metric spaces are first-countable, so we only need to show that sequential compactness implies compactness. So, assume that $(X,d)$ is a sequentially compact metric space.
  
  Fix a real number $r > 0$. Then the collection $\{B_d(x,r) \mid x \in X\}$ is an open cover which we claim has a finite subcover: if it didn't, we could define a sequence $\{x_n\}$ with the property that
  \[
    x_{n+1} \notin \bigcup_{i=1}^n B_d(x_i,r).
  \]
  This sequence has the property that $d(x_n,x_m) > r$ for all $n \not= m \in \bbN$ so it can have no convergent subsequence (recall the characterization of convergence in metric spaces from Proposition~\ref{metric-convergence}), which is our contradiction, so there is a finite subcover $\{B_d(x_i,r)\}_{i=1,\dots,n}$.
  
  Now let $\calU = \{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. We claim that there is a real number $r > 0$ such that for every $x \in X$, $B_d(x,r) \subset U_i$ for some $i \in I$. This will complete the proof since then we could consider our finite subcover $\{B_d(x_\alpha,r)\}$ from before, and let $i_\alpha$ be so that $B_d(x_\alpha,r) \subset U_{i_\alpha}$. Then clearly, the finitely many $U_{i_\alpha}$ will cover $X$.
  
  So suppose once more for a contradiction that no such real number $r > 0$ exists. That is, suppose that for every $r > 0$ there exists an $x \in X$ so that $B_d(x,r)$ is not a subset of $U_i$ for any $i \in I$. In particular, for each $n \in \bbN$ we can choose $x_n$ so that $B_d(x_n,1/n)$ is not a subset of any $U_i$. Choose a convergent subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ of $\{x_n\}$, i.e. $x_{n_k} \to x$ for some $x$.
  
  Then $x \in U_j$ for some $j \in I$, and since $U_j$ is open, we have $B_d(x,1/N) \subset U_j$ for some $N \in \bbN$. Now choose a $K$ so large that $d(x_{n_k},x) < \tfrac{1}{2N}$ for all $k > K$. Let moreover $k > K$ be large enough that $n_k > 2N$. Then for every $y \in B_d(x_{n_k},1/n_k)$, we have
  \[
    d(y,x) \leq d(y,x_{n_k}) + d(x_{n_k},x) < \frac{1}{n_k} + \frac{1}{2N} < \frac{1}{2N} + \frac{1}{2N} = \frac{1}{N},
  \]
  so $B_d(x_{n_k},1/n_k) \subset B_d(x,1/N) \subset U_j$ which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Compactness in $\bbR^n$}
We will now turn to the promised characterisation of (sequentially) compact subsets in $\bbR^n$.

\begin{thm}
  \label{intervals-compact}
  A closed bounded interval $[a,b] \subset \bbR$ is compact.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ be an open cover of $[a,b]$, and consider the set
  \[
    M = \{x \in [a,b] \mid \text{$[a,x]$ is covered by finitely many $U_i$}\}.
  \]
  We are done if we can show that $M = [a,b]$. Clearly, $a \in M$. Let $m = \sup M > a$. Clearly $M$ is an interval, and we claim that $m = b$. Assume that $m < b$.
  
  Since $m \in [a,b)$, there is a $j \in I$ with $m \in U_j$. Since $U_j$ is open (in the subspace topology of the standard topology on $\bbR$), we get that $(m-\eps,m+\eps) \subset U_j$ and $m - \eps \in M$ for some small enough $\eps$. This says that $[a,m-\eps]$ is covered by finitely many $U_i$, so by adding $U_j$ to this collection, we see that also $[a,m+\eps/2]$ is covered by finitely many $U_i$. That is, $m+\eps/2 \in M$, which contradicts the fact that $m = \sup M$.  
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
  %A subset $A \subset X$ of a metric space $(X,d)$ is called \word{bounded}{begr{\"a}nsad} if there is a number $r > 0$ so that $d(x,y) \leq r$ for all $x,y \in A$.
  A subset $A \subset \bbR^n$ is called \word{bounded}{begr{\"a}nsad} if $A \subset [-K,K]^n$ for some $K > 0$.
\end{defn}
\trans{bounded}{begr{\"a}nsad}
\begin{thm}[Heine--Borel]
  \index{Heine--Borel theorem}A set $A \subset \bbR^n$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  If $A$ is compact, then $A$ is closed by Theorem~\ref{compact-in-Hausdorff}. If $A$ were not bounded, we could choose $x_k \in A$ with $d(x_k,0) > k$ for all $k \in \bbN$. Now clearly, the collection $U_k = A \cap B(0,k)$, $k \in \bbN$, is an open cover of $A$ but for all $k \in \bbN$ we see that $x_k \notin U_k$, so $\{U_k\}$ has no finite subcover, contradicting compactness, so $A$ is bounded.
  
  If $A$ is closed and bounded, $A \subset [-K,K]^n$ for some $K > 0$. Now $[-K,K]$ is compact by Theorem~\ref{intervals-compact}, so $[-K,K]^n$ is compact by Theorem~\ref{tikhonov-theorem}. Thus $A$ is compact by Theorem~\ref{closed-in-compact} (notice that $A$ is closed in the subspace topology on $[-K,K]^n$).
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
  If $X$ is compact and $f : X \to \bbR$ is continuous, then there are points $x_1$ and $x_2$ with $f(x_1) = \sup f(X)$, $f(x_2) = \inf f(X)$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  By Theorem~\ref{funcs-compact}, $f(X)$ is compact, so by the Heine--Borel theorem, $f(X)$ is closed and bounded. Thus $\sup f(X) < \infty$ and $\sup f(X) \in f(X)$, and similarly for $\inf$.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
  The $n$-sphere $S^n$ is compact.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  Clearly, the $n$-sphere is bounded. Notice that we can describe the sphere as $S^n = (\Abs{\cdot})^{-1}(\{1\})$, the pre-image of a closed set $\{1\}$ under the norm map $\Abs{\cdot} : \bbR^{n+1} \to \bbR$, which is continuous. Thus $S^n$ is closed, and therefore compact by the Heine--Borel theorem.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
  The genus $n$ surface from Example~\ref{surface-example} is compact for every $n$, since the $4n$-gon $X_n$ is closed and bounded, thus compact, and quotients of compact spaces are compact by Corollary~\ref{compact-quotient}.
\end{example}
\begin{thm}[Bolzano--Weierstrass]
  \index{Bolzano--Weierstrass}A set $A \subset \bbR^n$ is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  This follows immediately by combining Theorem~\ref{seq-compact-vs-compact} and the Heine--Borel theorem.
\end{proof}
% \begin{defn}
%   Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space with the metric topology. A sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $X$ is called a \word{Cauchy sequence}{Cauchy-f{\"o}ljd} if
%   \[
%     \forall \eps > 0,\ \exists N > 0 : \ m,n > N \Rightarrow d(x_m,x_n) < \eps.
%   \]
%   A metric space is called \word{complete}{fullst{\"a}ndigt} if every Cauchy sequence is convergent.

% \end{fact}
% \begin{thm}
%   The subspace $[0,1] \subset \bbR$ is sequentially compact.
% \end{thm}
We also now have the necessary tools to prove a claim we gave in Example~\ref{bag-closing-example}. Recall that we write $D^n$ for the closed unit ball in $\bbR^n$.
\begin{prop}
  \label{closing-the-bag}
  The quotient $D^n / \dd D^n$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  The strategy will be to construct a map $\hat{\psi}: D^n / \dd D^n \to S^n$ explicitly and then apply the last part of Theorem~\ref{funcs-compact}.
  
  First of all, notice that $D^n$ is closed and bounded, thus compact by the Heine--Borel theorem. Therefore $D^n / \dd D^n$ is compact since quotients of compact spaces are compact. On the other hand, $S^n$ is Hausdorff because it is a subspace of a Hausdorff space. It therefore suffices to construct $\hat{\psi}$, and show that it is a continuous bijection.
  
  Recall from Example~\ref{open-ball-homeomorphism} that there exists a homeomorphism $\phi : B^n \to \bbR^n$ from the \emph{open} ball $B^n = B(0,1)$ to $\bbR^n$ and from the proof of Proposition~\ref{north-pole-removed} that the inverse of the stereographic projection provides a homeomorphism $g : \bbR^n \to S^n \setminus \{p\}$, where $p$ is the north pole. Then also $g \circ \phi : B^n \to S^n \setminus \{p\}$ is a homeomorphism. Now define $\psi : D^n \to S^n$ by
  \[
    \psi(x) = \begin{cases} (g \circ \phi)(x),& \text{if $x \in B^n$,} \\ p,& \text{if $x \in \dd D^n$.} \end{cases}
  \]
  See Figures~\ref{ball}--\ref{sphere} for an illustration of the map $\psi$. We claim that $\psi$ is continuous, which will then complete the proof: since $\psi$ is constant on $\dd D^n$, Lemma~\ref{universal-property-quotients} provides us with a continuous map $\hat{\psi} : D^n / \dd D^n \to S^n$, which is continuous if $\psi$ is, and which is bijective by construction.
  
  To show that $\psi$ is continuous, we will show that it is continuous at each point. It is continuous on each point in $B^n$, since its restriction to $B^n$ is continuous, so it suffices to show that it is continuous at every point in $\dd D^n$, so let $x \in \dd D^n$, so let $U \subset S^n$ be a neighbourhood of $f(x) = p$, and let us find a neighbourhood $V$ of $x$ so that $\psi(V) \subset U$. Since $U$ is open, there is a $k$, $0 < k < 1$ so close to $1$ that
  \[
    \{ y \in S^n \mid k < y_{n+1} \leq 1 \} \subset U.
  \]
  Notice that for $z \in B^n$, by the proof of Proposition~\ref{north-pole-removed}, the $(n+1)$'st coordinate of
  \[
    y = g \circ \phi(z) = g\left(\frac{z}{1-\Abs{z}}\right)
  \]
  is exactly
  \[
    y_{n+1} = 1-t\left( \frac{z}{1-\Abs{z}} \right) = 1- \frac{2}{1+(\Abs{z}/(1-\Abs{z}))^2} = \frac{2\Abs{z} - 1 }{2\Abs{z}^2 - 2 \Abs{z} + 1}.
  \]
  It follows that there is $K$, $0 < K < 1$ so close to $1$ so that all $z \in D^n$ with $\Abs{z} > K$ satisfy $y_{n+1} > k$. Therefore, if we let $V = \{z \mid \Abs{z} > K\}$, we have
  \[
    \psi(V) \subset \{ y \in S^n \mid k < y_{n+1} \leq 1 \} \subset U.
  \]
\end{proof}

\subsection{Local compactness and one-point compactification}
In this section we will see how we can turn a Hausdorff space into a compact space by adding one more point, in a way that the open sets of the original space are still open. We will also see that the new space is Hausdorff itself, as long as it looks sufficiently much like a compact space close to points.
\begin{defn}
  Let $(X,\calT)$ be a Hausdorff space. The \word{one-point compactification}{enpunktskompaktifiering} of $X$ is the space $\hat{X} = X \cup \{\star\}$ obtained from $X$ by adding a single point, called $\star$, equipped with the topology
  \[
    \hat{\calT} = \calT \cup \{ (X \setminus K) \cup \{\star\} \mid \text{$K \subset X$ compact} \}.
  \]
\end{defn}
\trans{one-point compactification}{enpunktskompaktifiering}
The point $\star$ is often called the \emph{point at infinity}\index{point at infinity}.
\begin{prop}
  The collection $\hat{\calT}$ is actually a topology on $\hat{X}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Exercise~3.\ref{one-point-exercise}.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
  The one-point compactification is compact.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\calU = \{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover of $\hat{X}$ and let us show that it has a finite subcover. There is a $j \in I$ so that $\star \in U_j$. Clearly, $U_j \in \hat{\calT} \setminus \calT$, so we see that $U_j = (X \setminus K) \cup \{\star\}$ for a compact set $K \subset X$.
  
  Now clearly, $\{U_i \cap K\}_{i \in I}$ is an open cover of $K$, so by compactness there are $i_1, \dots, i_n$ so that $\{U_{i_1} \cap K, \dots, U_{i_n} \cap K\}$ cover $K$ by compactness. In particular, $K \subset U_{i_1} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n}$. Now
  \[
    \hat{X} = X \setminus K \cup \{\star\} \cup K = U_j \cup K \subset U_j \cup U_{i_1} \cup \dots \cup U_{i_n},
  \]
  so we have found a finite subcover.
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
  A topological space is called \word{locally compact}{lokalt kompakt} if every point $x \in X$ has a neighbourhood contained in a compact subspace. I.e. if there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ and a compact set $K \subset X$ so that $x \in U \subset K \subset X$.
\end{defn}
\trans{locally compact}{lokalt kompakt}
\begin{prop}
  If $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, then its one-point compactification is Hausdorff.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $x,y \in \hat{X}$ be given, and assume that $x \not= y$. If $x,y \in X$, then we are done since $X$ is Hausdorff and the open sets in $\hat{X}$ include those that are open in $X$.
  
  So, assume that $x \in X$ and $y = \star$. Let $U \subset X$ be any neighbourhood at $x$, and choose a set $K \subset X$, compact in $X$, so that $x \in U \subset K \subset X$. It follows that $U \cap ((X \setminus K) \cup \{\star\}) = \emptyset$, and since $(X \setminus K) \cup \{\star\}$ is a neighbourhood of $\star$, we are done.
\end{proof}

Before going into details on what the one-point compactification looks like, let us provide some examples of locally compact spaces.

\begin{example}
  All compact spaces are locally compact.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  Euclidean space $\bbR^n$ is locally compact. For instance, for any $x$, $\bar{B(x,1)}$ is compact (by the Heine--Borel theorem) and contains $B(x,1)$.
\end{example}
Now as the inquisitive reader will have noticed, the word ``locally'' used in our definition of ``locally compact'' does not quite match up with how we used the word when talking about locally connected and locally path-connected spaces. The next result says that for Hausdorff spaces, the use of the word ``local'' will agree in these various cases.
\begin{thm}
  \label{local-compactness-in-hausdorff}
  Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. Then $X$ is locally compact if and only if for very $x \in X$ and every neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, there is a neighbourhood $V$ of $x$ so that $\bar{V}$ is compact and $\bar V \subset U$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Exercise.
\end{proof}
We can use this to create a ton of locally compact spaces as subspaces of locally compact spaces. As for compact spaces, whenever we say that a subset of a topological space is locally compact, we mean that it is locally compact in the subspace topology.
\begin{prop}
  If $X$ is a locally compact space, and let $A \subset X$ be a subspace. Then $A$ is locally compact if $A$ is closed. If furthermore $X$ is Hausdorff, then $A$ is locally compact if $A$ is open.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $A$ is closed, and let $x \in A$. Let $K$ and $U$ be a compact subspace and neighbourhood of $x$ respectively, with $x \in U \subset K \subset X$. Now $A \cap K$ is closed and thus compact by Theorem~\ref{closed-in-compact}. Also, $U \cup A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, and $x \in U \cap A \subset K \cap A \subset A$, so $A$ is locally compact.
  
  Assume now that $X$ is Hausdorff, let $A$ be open, and let $x \in A$. Then $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, and by Theorem~\ref{local-compactness-in-hausdorff} we obtain a neighbourhood $V$ of $x$ so that $\bar{V}$ is compact, and $\bar{V} \subset A$, so $A$ is locally compact.
\end{proof}
Equipped with a number of examples, we now look at concrete examples of one-point compactifications. First we show that one-point compactifications are in a certain sense unique.
\begin{prop}
  \label{one-point-compactification-unique}
  Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Suppose that $Y$ has the properties that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $X$ is a subspace of $Y$,
    \item $Y \setminus X$ consists of a single point, and
    \item $Y$ is compact and Hausdorff.
  \end{enumerate}
  If $Y'$ is another space with the same properties, then $Y \simeq Y'$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Exercise.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
  \label{self-compactification}
  If $Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space, then $\hat{Y \setminus \{x\}} \simeq Y$ for any $x \in Y$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  This follows from Proposition~\ref{one-point-compactification-unique} since both $\hat{Y \setminus \{x\}}$ and $Y$ have the listed properties, where, in the notation of the proposition, $X = Y \setminus \{x\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
  We have $\hat{\bbR^n} \simeq S^n$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  This follows immediately from Proposition~\ref{self-compactification} and Proposition~\ref{north-pole-removed}.
\end{proof}
One way to picture this result is shown in Figure~\ref{one-point-compactification-figure}, which also illustrates why we call $\star$ a ``point at infinity''.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.3\linewidth]{images/one-point-compactification}
  \caption{Illustration of $\hat{\bbR} \simeq S^1$: we add a point at infinity and tie up the entire real line so it connects at this point.}
  \label{one-point-compactification-figure}
\end{figure}

Our next result says that under certain conditions, continuous maps between Hausdorff spaces extend to the one-point compactifications.

\begin{defn}
  A continuous map $f : X \to Y$ is called \word{proper}{?} if $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact, whenever $K \subset Y$ is compact.
\end{defn}
\trans{proper}{?}
\begin{prop}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be Hausdorff spaces, let $f : X \to Y$ be a proper map, and let $\hat{X} = X \cup \{\star_X\}$ and $\hat{Y} = Y \cup \{\star_Y\}$ denote the one-point compactifications. Then the map $\hat{f} : \hat{X} \to \hat{Y}$ given by
  \[
    \hat{f}(x) = \begin{cases} f(x),& \text{if $x \in X$,} \\ \star_Y,&\text{if $x = \star_X$,} \end{cases}
  \]
  is continuous.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $U \subset \hat{Y}$ be open. If $U \subset Y$, then $\hat{f}^{-1}(U) = f^{-1}(U)$ is open since $f$ is continuous. On the other hand, if $\star_Y \in U$, we know that $U = (Y \setminus K) \cup \{\star_Y\}$ for some compact set $K$ in $Y$. Then
  \[
    f^{-1}(U) = f^{-1}(Y \setminus K) \cup \{\star_X\} = (X \setminus f^{-1}(K)) \cup \{\star_X\}.
  \]
  Since $f$ is proper, $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact in $X$, so this says that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open.
\end{proof}

We end this section with a discussion of an example of a space that is \emph{not} locally compact. Consider the vector space
\[
  \bbR^\infty = \{ x : \bbN \to \bbR \} = \{\{x_n\}_{n \in \bbN} \mid x_n \in \bbR\}
\]
of all sequences of real numbers. For any $p \in [1,\infty)$ and $x \in \bbR^\infty$, define the $p$-norm of $x$ by
\[
  \Abs{x}_p = \left( \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \abs{x_n}^p \right)^{1/p},
\]
and the $\infty$-norm by
\[
  \Abs{x}_\infty = \sup_{n \in \bbN} \{\abs{x_n}\}.
\]
Now for any $p$, $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, notice that $\Abs{\cdot}_p$ actually defines a norm, meaning that $\Abs{x}_p \geq 0$ for all $x \in \bbR^\infty$, that $\Abs{x}_p = 0$ only if $x$ is the constant sequence $x_n = 0$, that $\Abs{r x}_p = \abs{r} \Abs{x}_p$ for all $r \in \bbR$, $x \in \bbR^\infty$, and that $\Abs{x+y}_p \leq \Abs{x}_p + \Abs{y}_p$ for all $x, y \in \bbR^\infty$. Put
\[
  \ell^p = \{ x \in \bbR^\infty \mid \Abs{x}_p < \infty \}.
\]
The norm can be used to define a metric on $\ell^p$ by $d_p(x,y) = \Abs{x-y}_p$, which in turn can be used to give $\ell^p$ the metric topology.

\begin{prop}
  The topological space $\ell^p$ is not locally compact for any $1 \leq p \leq \infty$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $U$ be any neighbourhood of the constant sequence $0 \in \ell^p$. We claim that there is no compact subspace containing $U$. Since $U$ is open, there is an $\eps > 0$ so that $B_{d_p}(0,\eps) \subset U$. For each $n \in \bbN$, define a sequence $\delta_n = \{ x_m\}_{m\in \bbN}$ by
  \[
    x_m = \delta_{m,n} = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if $m = n$}, \\0, &\text{otherwise.} \end{cases}
  \]
  Then for any $n \in \bbN$, we have $\Abs{\delta_n}_p = 1$ for all $p$, $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, so $\delta_n \in \ell^p$.
  
  Put $y_n = \tfrac{\eps}{2} \delta_n$. Then for all $n$ and $p$, $\Abs{y_n}_p = \tfrac{\eps}{2}$, so $y_n \in B_{d_p}(0,\eps)$. We claim that the sequence of sequences $\{y_n\}$ has no convergent subsequence; this then means that $B_{d_p}(0,\eps)$ is not contained in any sequentially compact space, and we obtain the proposition from Theorem~\ref{seq-compact-vs-compact}.
  
  To see that $\{y_n\}$ has no convergent subsequence, notice that for $n, m \in \bbN$, $n \not= m$, we have
  \[
    d_p(y_n,y_m) = \frac{\eps}{2} d_p(\delta_n,\delta_m) = \frac{\eps}{2} \Abs{\delta_n-\delta_m}_p = \begin{cases} \tfrac{\eps}{2} 2^{1/p}, & p \in [1,\infty), \\ \tfrac{\eps}{2}, & p = \infty. \end{cases}
  \]
  In either case, $d_p(y_n,y_m) \geq \tfrac{\eps}{2}$, so $\{y_n\}$ has no convergent subsequence.
\end{proof}
