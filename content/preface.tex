\section{Preface}
\label{preface}
These are lecture notes written for a course on elementary point set topology given at Uppsala University during the spring of 2015. The notes are, at the time of writing, \emph{not} intended as a full reference for the course. Rather, the course will follow the references \cite{Mun} and \cite{Fje}, and these notes serve to show which parts of the main references we have covered in the lectures.

The notes will be written as the course moves along and may be discontinued at any moment, depending on time restrictions. As such, they are also likely to contain typos and errors of other kinds; if you come across any such, feel very free to let me know, either by email at \href{mailto:s@fuglede.dk}{\textsf{s@fuglede.dk}}, or by letting me know in person. Concrete changes can also be proposed directly at \href{https://github.com/fuglede/basic-topology}{\textsf{https://github.com/fuglede/basic-topology}}.
