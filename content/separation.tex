\section{Separation and countability axioms}
\label{separation}
We encountered the first separation axioms in Section~\ref{separation-1}; in this section we introduce further notions of separations. We have already seen how the property of being $T_2$ allows many useful results, and in the same spirit we will see how having more fine-grained separation allows for further characterisation of topological spaces.
