\section{Separation and countability axioms}
\label{separation}
We encountered the first separation axioms in Section~\ref{separation-1}; in this section we introduce further notions of separations. We have already seen how the property of being $T_2$ allows many useful results, and in the same spirit we will see how having more fine-grained separation allows for further characterisation of topological spaces.
\subsection{Separation -- part 2}
\begin{defn}
  A topological space is called \word{regular}{regulj{\"a}rt} if for every closed set $F \subset X$ and any point $x \in X \setminus F$ there exist open sets $U_x, U_F \subset X$ so that $x \in U_x$, $F \subset U_F$, and $U_x \cap U_F = \emptyset$.
  
  A regular $T_1$-space is called $T_3$\index{T_3}.
\end{defn}
\trans{regular}{regulj{\"a}rt}
