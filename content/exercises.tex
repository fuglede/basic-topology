\section{Exercises}
The exercises are split into four sets, corresponding to the four exercise sessions held as part of the course. Many of the exercises are collected from previous iterations of the course, and these in turn may originate from \cite{Hum}.

\subsection{Set \#1}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Define a relation on $\bbR$ by
    \[
      C=\{(x,y) \mid x - y \in \bbZ \}.
    \]
    Show that $C$ is an equivalence relation and describe the equivalence classes of $C$.
  \item Describe all possible topologies on the set $X = \{a,b,c\}$.
  \item Let $X$ be a set, and let $\calT_1$ and $\calT_2$ be two different topologies on $X$. When is the identity map $\id_X : X \to X$ given by $\id_X(x) = x$ a continuous map from $(X,\calT_1)$ to $(X,\calT_2)$.
  \item \begin{itemize}
		\item[($a$)] Show that the subspace topology $\calT_Y$ is the smallest (meaning coarsest) topology on $Y\subset X$ for which the inclusion $\iota:Y \rightarrow X$ is a continuous map.
		\item[($b$)] Let $Y\subset X$ be an open (closed) subset of a topological space $X$. Decribe the open (closed) subsets of $Y$ in the subspace topology
	\end{itemize}
    
  \item The Euclidean space $\bbR^2$ can be identified with the Cartesian product $\bbR \times \bbR$. Use Lemma~\ref{compare-bases} to show that the standard topology on $\bbR^2$ equals the product topology from $\bbR$ (were each $\bbR$ has the standard topology).
  
  \item \label{metric-Hausdorff} Show that metric spaces are always Hausdorff.
\end{enumerate}
